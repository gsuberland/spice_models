# SPICE models

This repo contains SPICE models that I created to fill gaps where a vendor either did not provide a SPICE model, or provided one that was so broken I had no choice but to build my own.

Accuracy and correctness are not guaranteed. You should always verify that a SPICE model behaves as expected, in line with the datasheet and your own measurements, before trusting it for your own simulations. Vendors get this wrong all the time and I am far from infallible.

## Support

**Consider everything in this repo to be "fire-and-forget".** I made these models for personal use and you can use them if you like, but I have absolutely no intention of maintaining any of the models.

If you find that a model is wrong somehow, feel free to create an issue so that others can see what you've discovered, but the chances of me actually doing anything about it are effectively nil. I don't have the time.
